# This tmux configuration is passed to the -f option of tmux
# when I start a session via ssh. It's for configuration that doesn't make
# sense in a non-ssh session.
# This was only for the SSH_AUTH_SOCK stuff, and now I do that in my
# .bashrc instead, so this file is no longer called. It's kept for reference.

# Put ssh agent in a predictable place
# (see also ~/.ssh/rc)
set-environment -g SSH_AUTH_SOCK $HOME/.ssh/ssh_auth_sock
set -g update-environment "SSH_AGENT_PID SSH_ASKPASS SSH_CONNECTION WINDOWID XAUTHORITY"
