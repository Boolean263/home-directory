# This file contains gitattributes that are applied globally across
# all git repos I work on (subject to their own attributes of course).
# It relies on the diff and filter drivers I define in
# ~/git-config/git-filters (see my ~/.gitconfig).

# We can define our own attributes with the [attr] keyword. The 'binary'
# attribute is built-in, but I redefine it here to give a more useful
# diff message than "Binary files differ".

[attr]binary -text diff=filesize
[attr]dostext text filter=dostext
[attr]image -text diff=exif

# And now, the actual attributes.
